DIY Drone Kit

Welcome to the DIY Drone Kit repository! This project is designed for drone enthusiasts who want to assemble their own drone, understand its working principles, and expand its capabilities. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced maker, this kit provides all the tools and resources you need to get started.
üìñ Instructions

Comprehensive step-by-step directions for assembling and operating the drone are included in the PDF guide provided with the kit. The PDF contains:

    Assembly Instructions: How to build the drone.
    Setup Guide: How to configure the software and hardware components.
    Troubleshooting: Common issues and their solutions.

To access the instructions:

    Download the PDF file included in this repository or from your kit's package.
    Follow the steps carefully to complete your drone assembly and configuration.

üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview

This repository contains various pieces of code to help you understand the drone's operation and give you the flexibility to modify or expand its capabilities.
1. BLE Server Code

    Manages the Bluetooth communication between the drone and the controller app.
    Supports commands for takeoff, landing, and in-flight adjustments.

2. Android App Code

    Source code for the companion app that communicates with the drone via Bluetooth.
    Includes joystick-based flight controls and a block-coding interface for custom flight patterns.

3. Drone Flight Controller Code

    Embedded software that runs on the drone's microcontroller.
    Handles motor control, flight stabilization, and navigation logic.

4. Test Code

    Scripts and programs to test individual components like sensors and communication modules.
    Ensures that all hardware and software components are functioning as expected.

How to Use the Code

    BLE Server:
        Upload the BLE server code to the Bluetooth-enabled raspberry pi.
        Pair the drone with the Android for communication.

    Flight Controller:
        Upload the flight controller code into the same file as the BLE.
        
    Test Code:
        Run the test scripts to calibrate and ensure all components are working before connecting with the app.

    Android App:
        Open the Android_App folder in Android Studio.
        Build and install the app on your Android device.
        Use the app to control your drone via Bluetooth.
